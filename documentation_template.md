# AI Applications Project Documentation Template

Use this template to document your project concisely and completely.
Fill in all required fields. Keep answers short and precise.

## Documentation Hint

Important:
When possible, reference the corresponding code location directly in your description.

### Example: Reference to a notebook section
Reference to the header `## Data Preprocessing` in the notebook `analysis.ipynb`:

> See *Data Preprocessing* in
> [`analysis.ipynb`](analysis.ipynb#data-preprocessing)

### Example: Reference to Python code

Reference to a single line in `model.py`, line 42:
> [`model.py`, line 42](model.py#L42)

Reference to multiple lines in `train.py`, lines 15-38:
> [`train.py`, lines 15-38](train.py#L15-L38)

- [ ] Deployment URL provided
- [ ] Required GitHub users added to repository (`jasminh`, `bkuehnis`)

## Selected AI Blocks

- [ ] ML Numeric Data
